# How to Fix Bluetooth Connection on Linux

## Please note that for this solution to work, I was using Ubuntu 20.04.

If you have a different version, you will have to confirm if it works I can't confirm.

## Solution

- Clone or Download this repository
- Extract and `move` folder named `brcm` to `lib/firmware/`

- There exists a folder with that name you should either rename or delete and then copy the new `bcrm` folder
- Please restart your pc if the changes do not seem to work immediately
