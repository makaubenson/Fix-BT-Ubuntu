# How to Fix

## Please not for this solution to work, i was using Ubuntu 20.04.

If you have a different vbersion you will have to confirm if it works i cant confirm.

## Solution

- Clone/ Download this repository
- Extract and `move` folder named `brcm` to `lib/firmware/`

- There exists a folder with that name you should either rename or delete and then copy the new `bcrm` folder
