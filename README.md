# How to Fix

## Please not for this solution to work, i was using Ubuntu 20.04. 
If you have a different vbersion you will have to confirm if it works i cant confirm.


## Solution 
- clone the repo
- Extract and copy folder named `brcm` to `lib/firmware/`

- There exists a folder with that name you should either rename or delete and then copy the new `bcrm` folder
